# CHANGELOG

> **Note:** Apollo's GraphQL VSCode extension is no longer housed in this repository. It is now maintained separately in [this repo](https://github.com/apollographql/vscode-graphql).

## vNEXT

    just re-exports them. Internally, this drastically simplifies the existence of apollo-env within this monorepo, as it no longer requires a special build step that forces lerna and TS to work around it.
